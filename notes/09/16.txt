How do I do the fingerprint, that means I have to build a profile (a subsequence of packet sizes and timing maybe). 
First, I might have to cluster these data points. What do I use? 
With clustering bursts, we might be able to get rid of non-message traffic 

Copy data collection from the PingPong paper. 
Copy the "all-encompassing" nature from the other IoT IP/port paper

Extracting packet sequence from the bursts and clustering them
Finding these subsequences within these pcaps
